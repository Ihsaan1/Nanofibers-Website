            <h3 id="home_subtitle">Introduction to Nanofibres</h3> <!--Into Title-->
            <p id="home_info">Nanofibers are fibers with diameter in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers. They are widely used in various biomedical applications such as drug delivery, gene delivery, cell therapy, <br>
                cancer therapy, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. In fact, the nanofibers have been proven to be much more efficient systems for cellular and molecular applications <br>
                as compared to their micro- or macro-scale counterparts, owing to their functional properties such as large surface area, high aspect ratio, superior surface properties, quantum <br>
                confinement effects, and fast-absorbing ability of biomolecules, which provides abundant binding sites to cell receptors and thus allowing a strong cell-matrix interaction to take <br>
                place while engineering cells, tissues, and organs. For example, electrospun chitin nanofibers induced significantly higher levels of attachment and spreading of normal human <br>
                 keratinocytes and fibroblasts than the commercially available chitin microfibers. Additionally, the chitin nanofibers showed better degradability in vitro as well as <br>
                  in vivo within 15 and 28 days, respectively, when compared with chitin microfibers; no sign of in vivo inflammation response was observed. It is interesting to point out that some of <br>
                   the functional properties of nanofiber materials such as mechanical strength, structural integrity, surface morphology, porosity, and chemical functionalities could be tailored, to <br>
                    some extent, specifically to the biomedical application, by modulating the fiber alignment, orientation, dimension, and material composition. Despite the numerous advantages <br>
                     of monophasic nanofibers, some of the biomedical applications specifically require the use of nanofiber composites owing to their superior structural and functional properties. <br> <br>

                Nanofiber composites are the engineered materials composed of two or more distinct phases combined to impart new and desirable physical, chemical, and/or biological properties, <br>
                 which will have bulk properties significantly different form those of any of the constituent phases. The matrix and reinforcing phases are the two components of the nanofiber composites. <br>
                  The matrix phase (also called continuous phase) is the primary phase, which is usually more ductile and less hard, and the reinforcing phase (also called secondary phase or dispersed <br>
                  phase) is embedded within the matrix, which is usually stronger than the matrix phase, as the name implies. A synergism produces material properties available from the individual <br>
                   constituent phases, while the wide variety of available polymer nanofibers and reinforcing phases allows for the choice of the optimum combination for the specific application. Evidently, <br>
                    considerable research has already been carried out on nanofiber composites and it has been demonstrated that the nanofiber composites are better option than their monophasic <br>
                     nanofibers for some of the biological and biomedical applications. For example, mechanical and cellular properties of polycaprolactone (PCL)/chitosan nanofiber composites are superior <br>
                      to the chitosan nanofibers for nerve tissue engineering. In fact, an increased cell proliferation (>50%) occurred on the PCL/chitosan nanofiber composite system when compared to <br>
                      monophasic chitosan nanofiber system. All these experimental evidences, and other reported data, clearly indicate the importance of nanofiber composites for use in various biomedical <br>
                      applications.
