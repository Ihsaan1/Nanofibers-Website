                <h3 id="uon_subtitle">The Uses of Nanofibers</h3>
                <p id="uon_info">Nanofibers have found applications across various industries and fields, including biomedical and healthcare, environmental <br> remediation, textiles and apparel, 
                    electronics, and energy. Nanofibers are used in tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, <br> wound dressings, and scaffolds for regenerative medicine. They are employed in air and 
                    water filtration, adsorption of <br> pollutants, and removal of contaminants. Textiles and clothing use nanofibers for enhanced breathability, moisture management, <br> and antibacterial 
                    properties. Nanofibers are utilized in flexible and conductive materials, as well as in sensors and electronic <br> components. Nanofibers also play a role in energy 
                    storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, as well as in photovoltaic <br>     materials and fuel cells. 

                    <br> 
                    <br>

                    One example, of the uses of nanofibers, is the Military Field. In the military, nanofibers are used to improve the ability to detect chemical <br>
                     and biological agents with maggioreselectivity. Protective structures, composed of nanofibers, have improved the protection of military <br>
                      personnel due to their ability to filter and decompose toxins.

                      <br>
                      <br>

                      This particular field of application has given rise to self-cleaning/self-detoxifying personnel protection devices. These devices mainly <br>
                       consist of masks composed of two "layers": the first serving to filter the air and the second, a bed of activated carbon, which absorbs <br>
                        harmful gases and contaminants.
