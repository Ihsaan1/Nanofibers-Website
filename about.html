                <h3 id="about_subtitle1">What are Nanofibres?</h3>
                <p>Nanofibers are incredibly small, synthetic fibers – each measuring one thousand times thinner than a human hair. <br> 
                    Nanofibers form complex strength through spiderweb-like structures, which have an advantage over conventional <br> 
                    or even natural fibers due to their extraordinarily large surface area and tiny pore size. This combination creates <br>
                     maximum air flow and particle capture – significantly more than other synthetic or natural filters, achieving greater <br> 
                     efficiency down to PM0.3 microns. 
                     <br> <br>
                     Its small size provides an array of benefits when utilized in face mask technology – including advanced protection <br>
                     and better comfort. Featuring a weaving design closely packed together so microscopically that we are unable to <br>
                     see them with the human eye, nanofibers craft a small pore size and high surface-to-volume ratio. This means the <br>
                     surface area and pores of a face mask with nanofiber technology will not allow cells to pass through to reach the <br> 
                     wearer. Simply, due to the unique and tough threading of the nanofibers, everyday dangers such as pollution, <br> 
                     viruses, bacteria and more will be unable to cross the threshold of the mask, thereby enhancing protection from <br> 
                     the outside world. Not even water or liquid can penetrate the surface, which is why it is such an essential component <br> 
                     of any truly effective face mask. Additionally, this works two ways, as a mask is not only a protector of the individual <br> 
                     wearing the mask, but it also serves to halt the spread of germs as well. When you’re sick, you should have a mask <br>
                     on – especially if there are other people in your household or if you are traveling out to an appointment with a doctor. <br> 
                     Nanofibers block larger cells from escaping the mask, which helps to ensure less spread of any unpleasant or harmful <br> 
                     ailment to unsuspecting passersby or loved ones.
                     <br> <br>
                     While many are aware of the advanced protection that nanofibers provide in face mask technology, what may come as <br> 
                     a surprise is that this material is also significantly more comfortable than other fibers. The complexity of the microscopic <br> 
                     hair-like design makes the mask lightweight and, therefore, extremely breathable. It’s not simply a cloth over your face – <br> 
                     it’s a material that works with your body to trap cells out but allow air to flow in, so you don’t feel cramped or suffocated. <br> 
                     This also allows for better temperature regulation. More airflow means less of a “humid” feeling, as if the mask were a <br> 
                     part of your face rather than your face feeling as if it’s sweating into the mask. The light, soft and airy material of nanofibers <br> 
                     ensures both short-term and long-term wear is much more comfortable.
                    <br> <br>
                    Overall, nanofibers have revolutionized the way we keep people safe – with transformational applications in healthcare <br> 
                    advancements such as tissue engineering, wound dressings, face masks and more.

                <h3 class="about_info2">Origin of Nanofibres</h3>
                <p class="about_info2">
                    The first nanofibers were produced by electrospinning more than four centuries ago. The work by William Gilbert (in 1600) was <br> 
                    considered as an early example of what would become the modern electrospinning technology. Gilbert’s study is the first record <br> 
                    of the electrostatic attraction of a liquid. In 1845, Louis Schwabe invented a number of methods for spinning silk and creating <br> 
                    artificial fibers.
                    <br> <br>
                    In 1902, the American inventor John Francis Cooley patented the first electrospinning device: “Apparatus for electrically dispersing <br> 
                    fluids”. In 1912, Burton and Wiegand analyzed the effect of electricity on streams of water drops, and in 1914 John Zeleny studied <br> 
                    the behavior of fluid droplets at the end of metal capillaries.
                    <br> <br>
                    Between 1931 and 1944, Anton Formhals was granted at least 22 patents on electrospinning, including the first one (in 1934) on <br> 
                    the experimental production of fibers. In 1938, Rozenblum and Petryanov-Sokolov generated electrospun fibers that they used to <br> 
                    produce filter materials, known as “Petryanov filters”.
                    <br> <br>
                    In 1952, Radushkevich and Lukyanovich produced hollow graphitic carbon fibers, and Oberlin, Endo, and Koyama (1976) <br> 
                    developed a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to fabricate nanoscale carbon fibers. Between 1964 and 1969, Geoffrey <br> 
                    Ingram Taylor established the theoretical foundation of electrospinning.
                    <br> <br>
                    In 1966, Harold L. Simons patented an instrument to produce fiber fabrics with various patterns. The physicist Lord Rayleigh <br> 
                    published several articles (1978-1979) on the influence of electricity on colliding water drops and the equilibrium of liquid <br> 
                    conducting masses charged with electricity.
                    <br> <br>
                    In 1987, Charles Vernon Boys described the spinning process in an article on glass fiber manufacture The modern term <br> 
                    ‘electrospinning’ was popularized by Doshi and Reneker (1995) who produced fibers with a variety of cross-sectional shapes from <br> 
                    different polymers from 50 nm to 5 µm microns in size.  Since 1995, the number of publications on nanofibers has been increasing <br>
                    exponentially each year.
                    <br> <br>
                    In 2001, Wang used electrospinning to fabricate inorganic fibers. In 2005, the first book on nanofibers (title: “An Introduction to <br> 
                    Electrospinning and Nanofibers”) was published by Prof. Seeram Ramakrishna and co-author. In 2005, the Elmarco company <br>
                    developed NanospiderTM, the first technology in the world to enable the industrial scale production of nanofibers. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Currently, more than 200 universities and research institutes worldwide study various aspects of nanofiber production and their <br> 
                    characteristics. More and more articles are published on new nanofiber fabrication techniques, and this trend does not seem to <br> 
                    decline.
                    <br> <br>
                    Indeed, using the keywords nanofibers, nanofibres, nanofiber or nanofibre, the SciFinder database of chemical literature identified <br> 
                    23,728 articles up to October 2018. About 85% of these articles were published from 2006 to 2023 and still continues.
